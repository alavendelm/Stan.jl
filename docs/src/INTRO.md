# A Julia interface to CmdStan

## Stan.jl

[Stan](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan) is a system for statistical modeling, data analysis, and prediction. It is extensively used in social, biological, and physical sciences, engineering, and business. The Stan program language and interfaces are documented [here](http://mc-stan.org/documentation/).

[CmdStan](http://mc-stan.org/interfaces/cmdstan.html) is the shell/command line interface to run Stan language programs. 

[Stan.jl](https://github.com/goedman/Stan.jl) wraps CmdStan and captures the samples for further processing.

## A few other MCMC options in Julia

[Mamba.jl](http://mambajl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Klara.jl](http://klarajl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are other Julia packages to run MCMC models (in pure Julia!).

[Jags.jl](https://github.com/goedman/Jags.jl) is another option, but like CmdStan/Stan.jl, Jags runs as an external program.
